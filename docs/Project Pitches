Project Idea #1: 

Many of us listen to music in different languages, and we turn to google to translate the lyrics. Our team wants to create an app that generates lyrics 
translated to English on the screen as the song is playing, without having the user exit the app and search the translation of the lyrics externally. 
Alternatively, we also want to be able to translate songs in English to other languages, and give users the option of which language to translate to. For 
this, we'll be using the Spotify Web Player API for the songs, and Musixmatch for lyrics. Musixmatch already comes with translations, so we wouldn't need 
to use another API for translation. An extension of this app would be creating AI generated pictures based on the song lyrics. We would just feed the lyrics 
as input into the AI image generator to create a picture or an entire gallery ( Picture API:  https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/ )

Project Idea #2:

Similar to the Akinator app, we let the user have a real or fictional character in mind and give them some questions to answer with 'yes', 'no',
'don't know' or 'probably not' and the program should guess the answer. We want to modify it by using a photos APi to generate photo results for the answer.
We would use the Akinator API and a pictures API.
