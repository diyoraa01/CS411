We chose to use Node with the Angular framework for our technology stack. When researching possible stacks,
Node was the main stack that was under consideration, but we did have some internal debate on whether to use Angular or React. 
We ended up choosing Angular since we didn’t have much experience with it and thought it would be a good challenge to learn as we go. 
Angular also offers many different libraries that are easy to learn for front-end programming. 
We chose to use bootstrap because it offers a great routing system between different pages within our application. 
In the back-end, we chose to use python with the flask library to implement our API calls and system functions. 
On the front-end, we had another decision to make… Javascript or Typescript. We ended up choosing typescript since it is newer and offers the ability to create frameworks,
which we believe will be very helpful when we end up incorporating our database. 
For the database, we had to choose between an object-oriented database or a table-oriented database. We ended up going for the object-oriented database– MongoDB. 
This is because we think it will be simpler to implement for our intended purposes than a table-oriented database such as mySQL.
