Once the user is logged in (see User Story 1), the user will see the Spotify and
Musixmatch api embeds on their screen and have the option to search a song. The
user will be able to search a song in a search bar and be redirected to a page
with two tabs (one is for the translation and one is for the images). The user
will be able to click on the images tab and see the collage of images generated
by the AI Image Generator.
