A logged in user (see User Story 1) will have a history section that records all songs they searched and listened to before (see User Story 2). Also, they can keep all photos that they generated before. If the user has not used the application before, the history part would be empty. The user can also review the photos that were generated by other users for the same song. If the user wants, they can leave comments under the songs and reply to other users. Also, they can like other usersâ€™ comments and photos.
